# Machine Learning Knowledge Base

## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on developing systems that can learn from and make predictions based on data. Rather than following explicitly programmed instructions, these systems identify patterns in data and adjust their operations accordingly.

The field gained significant traction in the late 20th century but has experienced exponential growth since 2010 due to increased computational capabilities, larger datasets, and algorithmic innovations. Today, machine learning powers numerous applications from recommendation systems and natural language processing to computer vision and autonomous vehicles.

## Core Machine Learning Concepts
